          <li>HTML elements can be styled suing the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

          <li>Internal style sheets are entire stylesheet embeded directly in the HTML file usign a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>External style sheet is most common and is preferred because it keeps all CSS rules in a seperate file making design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
